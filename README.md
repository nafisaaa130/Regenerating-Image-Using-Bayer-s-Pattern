# Regenerating an Image by Simulating Bayer's Pattern and Using Directional Edge Interpolation
An input image will go through a method simulating Bayer's pattern. A color mosaic is generated representing one of the four Bayer's patterns. This pattern is goes through the process of demosaic, where the original colored channels for ALL pixels will be regenerated using directional edge interpolation. 

*More details to come...stay tuned*
